This is an implemntation of a doubly-linked-list wherein nodes contain both
forward and backward links. Insertion/removal can take place at the the back or 
front of the list. As a solution to dealing with edge cases, sentinel or dummy nodes 
are introduced, which mark the limits of a list. No insertion/removal can take place 
at or beyond these sentinel nodes.
