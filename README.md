# data-structures
A collection of data structure implementations using the C++ programming language.
# Overview
Each sub-directory is named by the data-structure it implements. To test each data structure, simply run the command "make" in a terminal, and the Makefile will handle testing. Each implementation contains a testing module class to minimally provide a visual of the working implementation (which the Makefile handles).
