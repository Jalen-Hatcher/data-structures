A queue implementation using a circularly-linked list, in which the cursor
is advanced with each call to enqueue(). As in the Clist, [] denotes the 
cursor node and -> a link between nodes.

#enqueue
elements 1,2,3,4 are enqueued to an empty queue in respective order where
ln denotes the nth element/node. The following reflect each successive change
to the queue:
[l1] -> [l1]
l1 -> [l2] -> l1 
l1 -> l2 -> [l3] -> l1
l1 -> l2 -> l3 -> [l4] -> l1

#dequeue
assume the resulting queue structure from the enqueue demonstaration. The following
reflects each successive change to the queue after 3 calls to dequeue():
[l4] -> l2 -> l3 -> [l4]
[l4] -> l3 -> [l4]
[l4] -> [l4]
